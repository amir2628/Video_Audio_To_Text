# Video_Audio_To_Text
A Python Application that takes your Video or Audio files in any language, and transform it to Text. It can be useful for anyone including students that study a new language.

I needed such an application at the time SO I created one for myself. Hope it helps you too.


## Packages in the Code:
tkinter,
moviepy,
speech_recognition

## Usage
If the language that you are looking for is not in the list you can add it in the Language Lists Dictionary.
